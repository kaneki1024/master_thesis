Cotton, the seed hair of plants of the genus Gossypium, and the purest form of cellulose available in nature, is the dominant natural fibre. Cotton has a multilayered structure which consists of a primary wall, a secondary wall and lumen. Under the microscope it looks like a twisted ribbon or like a collapsed and twisted tube. The strength of cotton has been attributed to its highly fibrillar and crystalline structure and its strength is increased by 25% when it is wet. Cotton is a good conductor of heat, is susceptible to damage by mildew, turns yellow and becomes weak when exposed to prolonged sunlight. It is easily flammable and has rather poor resistance to wear. The highest quality cotton varieties have the longest fibres, thin, with good resilience and elasticity which makes them easy to spin, suitable for the production of high-quality goods – especially garments. Recent advances have included production of genetically modified cotton (GM) and also organic cotton.},
